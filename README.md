## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

This was a great project for me where I really learned and understood the need for a "state" object to track and update the progress for the app. Also with the help of ChatGPT I managed to simplify my functions so each one does a small part and not overcomplicate the functions.

### Continued development

From here on I will continue my learning path on Frontend Mentor and work my way up to the next project.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - I always use this resource for looking up methods etc.
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) - I used ChatGPT to review my code whenever I got stuck.
